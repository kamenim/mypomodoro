        <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The first thing that you will
                notice at the start of the program is that the application navigational
                layout consists of both a Menu-Based Navigation and an Image-Based Navigation.
                We have also added navigation by providing the user with Keyboard Shortcuts
                to some of the features. The main difference between the three types
                of navigation is that the Menu-Based Navigation allows for the user
                to access all features of the application, whereas the Image-Based Navigation
                and Keyboard Shortcuts do not. The Keyboard Features provide the user
                with quick access to common features of this application. The Image-Based
                Navigation provides the user with quick access to common features used
                in the Pomodoro Technique™. The area below the Navigation Bars is
                what we call a panel. On the start screen the panel consists of just
                our logo, but in other panels they can contain lists, tables, details
                areas, places to log interruptions, timer, etc…</font></p>
