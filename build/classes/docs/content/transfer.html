        <h3>Transferring Tasks</h3><hr>
        <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The next step you need to do
                is to transfer the tasks to the ToDo List in the order you would like
                to complete them. In order to do this you must open the Manager panel.
                There are three ways to do this:</font></p>

        <ul type="DISC">
            <li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Click the View Menu
                    and select Manager in the Menu-Based Navigation.</font></li>
            <li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Press Alt + M</font></li>

            <li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Click the Manager
                    Icon from the Image-Based Navigation.</font></li>
        </ul>

        <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Then all you have to do is
                select the tasks you would like to transfer to the ToDo List one at
                a time and click the Add Button. Once you have the all of your tasks
                that you would like in your ToDo List, you can order them by selecting
                a task and clicking either the Promote or Demote Buttons. See also Manager
                panel, Menu-Based Navigation, Image-Based Navigation, and Keyboard Shortcuts.</font></p>
