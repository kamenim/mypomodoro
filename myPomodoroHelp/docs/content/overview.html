        <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">myPomodoro Software attempts
                to automate all of the manual processes and methods of the Pomodoro
                Technique™, removing the manual processes of writing, marking, transferring,
                and erasing items to and from the various sheets used in the Pomodoro
                Technique™. However in the process we have had to modify a few things
                to make it work. Within our program we have changed the names of the
                materials used in the Pomodoro Technique™ from the following to:

            <ul type="DISC">
                <li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Activity Inventory
                        Sheet </font><font size="3" face="Wingdings">è</font><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">
                        Activity List</font></li>
                <li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">ToDo Today Sheet </font><font size="3" face="Wingdings">è</font><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">
                        ToDo List</font></li>

                <li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Records Sheet </font><font size="3" face="Wingdings">è</font><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">
                        Report List</font></li>
            </ul>
        <p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">We
                have also have had to create a means to handle task creation, estimating
                Pomodoro’s, capturing actual Pomodoro’s, transferring tasks between
                sheets, task deletion, the handling of interruptions, voiding tasks,
                and marking tasks void and/or unplanned; which are all processes used
                in the Pomodoro Technique. Since this is indeed an automation of a manual
                task, we decided to implement a Digital Pomodoro Timer over that of
                a ticking Pomodoro Timer. We have also added features to help assist
                new users such as generating sample data and the ability to clear the
                entire database of all tasks, activities, and records. Within each list
                view, we have provided a details area so that a user can get more information
                on a task that is not listed in the table. Another additional feature
                is this, hopefully lovely and helpful, help system to get you started
                and on the right path to practicing the Pomodoro Technique™. The first
                screen you will see every time you open myPomodoro is the Start Screen,
                which a starting point for you to begin your use of the Pomodoro Technique™.
