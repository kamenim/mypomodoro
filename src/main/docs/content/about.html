        <p><a name="0.1__GoBack"></a><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">myPomodoro is
                a time management tool based upon the time management technique called
                the Pomodoro Technique™. The objectives of this software are to automate
                all the materials and methods used in the Pomodoro Technique™, which
                are otherwise preformed manually. </font></p>

        <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">This software was developed
                with Java, SQLite, XML, and HTML. The GUI was built using the Java Swing
                Toolkit. The first release was developed under the Waterfall Software
                Development Lifecycle (SDLC). The following releases were developed
                using the Scrum Framework and other Agile Methodologies. Not only did
                the team produce quality working software, but this project challenged
                us to apply common software project and industry practice, develop software
                under scope, resource, and time constraints, and develop software documentation
                using different methodologies and frameworks.</font></p>


        <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">It was developed for a Software
                Development Project at Georgia Gwinnett College (GGC) by students; Brian
                Wetzel, Paul Barton, Robert Forscht, and Jordan Smith.</font></p>
