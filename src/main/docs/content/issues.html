        <ul type="DISC">

            <li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Timer runs one full
                    break before stopping (not sure if an issue based on the Pomodoro Technique
                    because “Once a Pomodoro Starts you cannot stop it” (Pomodoro= 30
                    min = 25 min Uninterrupted Work + 5 min Break).</font></li>
            <li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Currently there
                    is no means to edit any data, you must delete that task you would like
                    to edit and add a new task.</font></li>
            <li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">No ticking noise
                    option on the timer.</font></li>
            <li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Little notification
                    between Pomodoro time and breaks.</font></li>
            <li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">If you have something
                    selected in any list and clear all data, the data from the last thing
                    selected remains in the details area for that panel.</font></li>
            <li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">On Windows XP, the
                    .ico file does not render properly.</font></li>

            <li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">At random times,
                    if you populate test data and go to the Activity List, you will see
                    two date columns. The next time the panel refreshes it’s gone. Does
                    not happen often.</font></li>
            <li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The timer shifts
                    whenever a 1 is displayed, this is due to a difference in font width
                    of the number 1 being different from the others.</font></li>
            <li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">No ability for the
                    user to develop sets within the application. The user can set up sets
                    by using their estimates and only transferring tasks one set at a time
                    into the ToDo List.</font></li>
